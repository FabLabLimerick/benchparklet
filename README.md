# The Limerick Parklet
This elective sought to improve an existing parklet bench design to make it easier and faster to assemble. The parametric bench exists as a set of 155 18mm Marine Plywood CNC cut panels, each of a different size and shape, connected by threaded bars, secured by bolts and seperated using CNC cut Marine Plywood spacers of 18mm nd 12mm thickness to produce a 30mm space between each panel.  
As the design was before starting this project, the bench could only be assembled by approximately 3 people at a time and in one direction only. Due to the parametric naure of the bench, the threaded bars were each of a different length and needed to be cut. So an aim of the elective was to speed up the construction process and standardise the materials required as much as possibe. 

##Cutting the Panels
  * **Elements Required** (_to create the entire bench_)
   1. Access to a CNC Router with a bed size of at least 1220x2440mm
   2. 26x 18mm 1220x2440mm Marine Plywood sheets
   3. 1x 12mm 1220x2440mm Marine Plywood sheet

##Grouping of 10 
In order to make the consruction easier and less time consuming, it was decided that the bench would be split into sections of 10 panels as this was considered a manageable size and weight for one person. By subdividing the bench into different sections, it allows each section to be preassembled off site so that on-site, simply attatching each section to eachother is the only assembly required. It also allows many different versions of the bench to be created as only 8 or 12 sections need be contructed, rather than all 15. If the bench is to be dismantled, it can be broken into the groupings of ten once more and stored in these groupings.

##Assembling 10
  * **Elements Required**
   1. A Set of 10 Numerically Ordered Panels
   2. 27x 18mm Spacers
   3. 27x 12mm Spacers
   4. 3x 485mm long, 12mm diameter threaded bars
   5. 6x 12mm diameter bolts  

Once all the correct parts have been gathered follow this process for each set  
* Attach a bolt to one end of three threaded bars
* Slot each of these bars through the holes on  the first panel, e.g Panel 1, Panel 11, Panel 21, etc.,
* Place an 18mm and a 12mm spacer on each bar
* Slot the following panel onto the bars, 
* Place an 18mm and a 12mm spacer on each bar once more
