# The Limerick Parklet
This elective sought to improve an existing parklet bench design to make it easier and faster to assemble. The Parametric bench exists as a set of 155 18mm Marine Plywood CNC cut panels, each of a different size and shape, connected by threaded bars and bolts and seperated using CNC cut Marine Plywood spacers of 18mm nd 12mm thickness to produce a 30mm shape between each panel.
