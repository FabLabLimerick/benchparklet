# The Limerick Parklet
This elective sought to improve an existing parklet bench design to make it easier and faster to assemble. The parametric bench exists as a set of 155 18mm Marine Plywood CNC cut panels, each of a different size and shape, connected by threaded bars, secured by bolts and seperated using CNC cut Marine Plywood spacers of 18mm nd 12mm thickness to produce a 30mm space between each panel.  
As the design was before starting this project, the bench could only be assembled by approximately 3 people at a time and in one direction only. Due to the parametric naure of the bench, the threaded bars were eac of a different length and needed to be cut. So an aim of the elective was to speed up the construction process and standardise the materials required as much as possibe. 

##Grouping of 10 
It was decided that the bench would be split into sections of 10 panels as this was considered a manageable size and weight for one person. By subdividing the bench into different sections, it allows each section to be preassembled off site so on-site, simply attatching each section to eachother is the only assembly required. It also alllows many different iterations of the bench to be created,
