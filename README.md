# The Limerick Parklet
This elective sought to improve an existing parklet bench design to make it easier and faster to assemble. The parametric bench exists as a set of 155 18mm Marine Plywood CNC cut panels, each of a different size and shape, connected by threaded bars, secured by bolts and seperated using CNC cut Marine Plywood spacers of 18mm nd 12mm thickness to produce a 30mm space between each panel.  
As the design was before starting this project, the bench could only be assembled by approximately 3 people at a time and in one direction only. Due to the parametric naure of the bench, the threaded bars were each of a different length and needed to be cut. So an aim of the elective was to speed up the construction process and standardise the materials required as much as possibe. 

##Cutting the Panels
  * **Elements Required** (_to create the entire bench_)
   1. Access to a CNC Router with a bed size of at least 1220x2440mm
   2. 26x 18mm 1220x2440mm Marine Plywood sheets
   3. 1x 12mm 1220x2440mm Marine Plywood sheet  
   
* Each plywood sheet must be loaded onto the CNC router bed and secured in place using at least one screw on each corner
  * ensure that these are no more than 20mm into the sheet as otherwise his will interfere with the drawing
* Open the file of the first sheet to be cut onto the relevant G-code software (in our case we used VCarve PRO)
* Assign the correct material qualities, e.g. the 1220x2440mm sheet size and 18mm thickness
* The holes will be drilled first: On the drawing, select all holes to be drilled and assign them a drilling toolpath, with a depth of about 19mm (this ensures that the CNC will cut through the whole material) and select that the drill follows the inside path of the line
* Next the labelling numbers will be engraved, or pocketed, into the panels. Select all the numbers and assign them a pocketing toolpath with a depth of 9mm
* Lastly the Panels themselves will be cutout. Select the panel outlines and assign them a cutting profile. Again, assign the depth to be 19mm to ensure that the are entirely cut out and select that the drill follows the outside path of the line. When cutting out elements, rather than drilling or engraving, tabs must be added to make sure that the panels do not move as they are being cut out. Add about 4 tabs to each panel.
* Once all toolpaths have been assigned, save the file and open it in the relevant software that your CNC machine can read (In our case, ShopBot3).
* Correct the x,y and z co-ordinates of the CNC and then begin cutting the file.
  * Ensure that safety procedures are followed, e.g. Dust extraction is turned on and that safety goggles and ear protection is worn.


##Grouping of 10 
In order to make the consruction easier and less time consuming, it was decided that the bench would be split into sections of 10 panels as this was considered a manageable size and weight for one person. By subdividing the bench into different sections, it allows each section to be preassembled off site so that on-site, simply attatching each section to eachother is the only assembly required. It also allows many different versions of the bench to be created as only 8 or 12 sections need be contructed, rather than all 15. If the bench is to be dismantled, it can be broken into the groupings of ten once more and stored in these groupings.

##Cutting the Threaded Bar
  * **Elements Required**
   1. Access to an Angle Grinder
   2. <**((((CORRECT NUMBER)))))**> of threaded bar  
In order for each set of ten panels to be able to be attached to each other, the threaded bars must be cut to 485mm lenghts, this is just enough to attach the 10 panels and be able to secure a bolt at each end. If it was any longer, it would disrupt the spacing between sets. Ensure safety precautions are employed with the use of the angle grinder, e.g. wear protective clothing and eye protection etc.. After the bars are cut, they must be filed down to ensure that the bolt will fit correctly and that the elements will not be too sharp.

##Assembling a set of 10
  * **Elements Required**
   1. A Set of 10 Sequential Panels
   2. 27x 18mm Spacers
   3. 27x 12mm Spacers
   4. 3x 485mm long, 12mm diameter threaded bars
   5. 6x 12mm diameter bolts  

Once all the correct parts have been gathered follow this process for each set  
* Attach a bolt to one end of three threaded bars
* Slot each of these bars through the holes on  the first panel, e.g. Panel 1, Panel 11, Panel 21, etc.,
  * Ensure that the number on the panel is facing outwards, e.g, not facing in the direction where the next panel will be placed.
* Place an 18mm and a 12mm spacer on each bar
* Slot the following panel onto the bars, e.g. Panel 2, Panel 12, Panel 22 etc.,
* Place an 18mm and a 12mm spacer on each bar once more
* Repeat this process until all ten panels have been attached together
* To close the set: Attach the remaining 3 bolts to the ends of the threaded bars
